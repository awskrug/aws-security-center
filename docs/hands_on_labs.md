# AWS Security 관련 핸즈온 랩 및 데모

AWS 보안 관련 핸즈온 랩 및 데모 사이트 링크들을 모아 놓았습니다. AWS 보안 기능, 서비스, 파트너 제품, 모범 사례 등 다양한 내용들을 링크의 가이드에 따라 직접 실습을 해 보면서 보다 잘 이해하실 수 있습니다.

**주의 사항**

* 본 목록의 핸즈온 랩 및 데모를 진행하는데는 대부분의 경우 비용이 발생합니다. AWS 요금 또는 파트너 제품의 사용 요금 등 제반 비용에 대해서는 기본적으로는 실습자 부담이기 때문에, 각 핸즈온 랩 가이드에 나와 있는 비용 관련 내용을 숙지하고 실습 여부를 판단해야 합니다.
* 특별한 이유가 없는 한, 실습 후에는 반드시 실습 환경을 삭제하여 더이상 과금되지 않도록 각별히 유념하시기 바랍니다.
